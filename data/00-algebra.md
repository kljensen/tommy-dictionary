Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. In elementary algebra, those symbols (today written as Latin and Greek letters) represent quantities without fixed values, known as variables. This is useful for several reasons. For example, if a certain number of apples is added to a certain number of oranges, one does not need to know beforehand how many apples and oranges there are. Instead the algebraic notation allows one to state the problem in general terms, and to consider it as a question of adding two unspecified numbers.

For example the following is an algebraic expression:

$$
3x + 2y = 8
$$
